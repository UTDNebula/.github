# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Nebula Labs GitHub!

## What is Nebula Labs?

Nebula Labs is an interdisciplinary group of ðŸŽ¨ designers, ðŸ’» engineers, ðŸ“‹ product specialists, and ðŸ“¢ marketing managers who strive to improve our community by creating and maintaining software.

Our mission is twofold: to build open-source software to help UTD students ðŸš€ and to cultivate a community for people to learn, grow, and thrive ðŸ’—. In other words: **We build Products and People.**

## How to Get Involved

Start attending meetings! You can find out when those are on our [Discord](https://discord.utdnebula.com/) or [Google Calendar](https://www.utdnebula.com/resources/calendar). Our Kickoff or monthly All Hands is a great place to start, but you can also just drop by any project meeting and talk to the project lead.

If you'd like to learn more about us first, check out our [Website](https://www.utdnebula.com/) and [Confluence](https://nebula-labs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/0YD5AQ).
